# Hello, is it me you're looking for?

I've been told repeatedly I need to "define my avatar" or "find my niche", and I've struggled. I think the reason is that lots of different people can use Schema Explorer for lots of different reasons. This has made creating content that any one of theses people can relate to challenging, so partly for my own edification I lay out here who I think it might be for.

## The db-guru coder

Always seem to end up with the database bits of the codebase.

Can use Schema Explorer to better explain what they've done to less db-loving team members, and to help the rest of the team code against the database with more self-serve and less mistakes.

## The team lead with new team member(s)

Eye on the time/cost for bringing someone up to speed.

Schema Explorer will cut the amount time the new team member spends not able to contribute meaningfully while they learn the system. This will help the team member be happier and more quickly be able to solve the important problems they were hired to help with.

## The high-brow team lead

Believes their team should have the best tools available.

If it makes your team even 0.01% better/stronger/faster then they need it. End of.

## The newbie on a team

Wants to not feel out of depth and unproductive, needs to understand schema fast.

## The systems integrator

Regularly encounters big legacy databases, has to work out how they work.

Use Schema Explorer to shine a light on the spaghetti, stand a hope in hell of getting it right.

## The architect

Wants to see that their plan has been correctly implemented.

Use Schema Exporer to inspect what the developer's ORM actually produced.

## The consultant

Wants to impress the client with how quickly they can master the client's software & db.

Buys tools, goes faster.

## The database administrator (DBA)

Lives and breathes the database. Knows much dark magic and has seen many horrors (mostly induced by ignorant developers).

Fed up with having to explain to the developers the basics of relational databases. Wouldn't be caught dead using this noddy web interface but happy to give it to everyone else so they can self serve and they can go back to saving the company from its own short-sighted stupidity (hey boss can I have the purchase order for the backup system yet?).
