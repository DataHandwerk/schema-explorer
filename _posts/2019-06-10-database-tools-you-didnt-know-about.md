title: Database tools I was surprised existed
description: A complete list of tools for database people and developers
category: blog
---

But you already know all the tools for working with databases don't you?

That's what I thought too before I started working on [SQL Schema
Explorer](http://schemaexplorer.io/). Even after 18 years working with
databases it turns out I only knew a fraction of the tools that are out there.

Working on SQL Schema Explorer gave me a reason I didn't have before to search
the internet in new ways relating to databases, and now that I'm reaching out
to people about SQL Schema Explorer people are in turn sharing their favourite
tools with me.

I'd hate for this gift to sit hidden away in my private product trello board,
so I've turned it into this article so that you can skip the wilderness years
and gain a zen-like awareness of all the tools of your trade. I'm sure you
won't like or use all of them, and many overlap in function, but the following
list will allow you to try out and asses each one against your needs; perhaps
you'll find a new tool that will save you hours, or make your job that much
more enjoyable. Never again will you have to say to a new colleague "oh I
hadn't heard of that one!".

## Microsoft Sql Server

### SSMS Tools Pack

<https://www.ssmstoolspack.com/>

An add-on to management studio that improves many pieces of of ssms and adds new capabilities.

* €30 for first computer to €5000 for unlimited enterprise use ([SSMS Toolpack
  Pricing page](https://www.ssmstoolspack.com/Licensing))

A friend of mine saved many hours using the "CRUD" stored procedure generation capabilities.

### Sql Server Management Studio (SSMS)

Okay you know this one but I have to mention it.

It has awkward but functional diagram support. You can version control these
diagrams and move them between servers with
<https://github.com/timabell/database-diagram-scm> which is worth knowing about
if you ever use the ssms diagrams.

### You can now run MSSQL on open source

Did you know Microsoft SQL Server (aka mssql) is now available on both linux
natively and in docker containers? It's the real deal, not like mono vs .net

* [SQL Server on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup)
* [SQL Server in Docker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker?view=sql-server-2017)

Here's all it takes to fire up mssql, the only pre-requisite is docker itself.

	docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=your_new_sa_passwod' \
	-p 1433:1433 --name mssql1 \
	-d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest

This isn't a tool per-se, but this is too important to not mention, especially
as it's quite new and not everyone is aware of this exciting change from
redmond.

I don't know about you but one less reason to fire up the Windows VM sure does
make me happy. Combined with dotnet core I haven't fired up Windows in months
now.

## Cross-database
