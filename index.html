<h2 id="hello">Hey there!</h2>

<p>
	I know you're skilled with databases but time is tight on the project and getting to know the database is time not shipping.
</p>

<p>
	I want to help, so I've built a new tool called Sql Schema Explorer which helps you understand a database faster than ever. 
</p>

<p>
	It's not quite like any of the other tools out there. You use it through your browser, but it runs locally so you don't have to worry about your data escaping to the internet. When you need to know what foreign keys a table has it's just one click in your browser, you can even click through related rows of data to see how everything fits together.
</p>

<p>
	There's a free trial with no missing features so you can try it out on your own machine with the database you are working on. There's no obligation to buy and no credit card required to try it. All I'm asking for is your feedback. Once you've fallen in love with it it's a small yearly cost to add it to your arsenal of SQL tools that make you the pro you are.
</p>

<p>
I think you should definitely try out Sql Schema Explorer with one of your own databases, I think you'll wish you'd had it years ago.
</p>
