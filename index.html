<h2 id="hello">Hey there!</h2>
<p>
I know you know your way around a database just fine, and you pride yourself on your SQL skills and being able to answer any question fast, but like me you still feel like simple questions are a hassle to answer when you're just trying to get that bug fixed or answer a question for the boss. Sometimes you want to get a colleague up to speed or discuss a design issue with them but the tools available to inspect a database slow down the conversation or derail it completely. Sometimes you're in the middle of a complex query or bit of code or are trying to answer an urgent question without losing focus on your current task. You just want to see what's in a table or what the columns and foreign keys look like but it's 10 fiddly clicks in the UI that comes with the database or it's a tedious distraction writing yet another one-off SQL statement. (You have a text file full of handy SQL of course, but they never quite fit today's question.)
</p>
<p>
You want to shine in your work, but the mental overhead of reading and writing raw SQL or using the tools available to answer what should be simple questions takes your focus away from the job at hand. Your mental stack is precious, and busywork that topples it is dangerous for productivity and avoiding mistakes. You're always on the look out for extra tools and tricks to make you better at your job, but nothing you've found so far has made the situation much better. It's not like relational databases are new or anything!
</p>
<p>
Well, I've made a little something to help you with that. Next time you have questions about a database or want to talk it over with a colleague you can fire up Sql Schema Explorer and suddenly table definitions, relationships and data are all there in your browser. So many questions are now quick to answer. You can go from first sight of a database to a really good feel for how it hangs together faster than ever before just by clicking around. You can share that easy to understand view when discussing interesting details with colleagues, technical or otherwise. Passing on knowledge and discussing the schema is now made easier by the tool instead of being hindered it.
</p>
<p>
I think you should definitely try out Sql Schema Explorer with one of your own databases, I think you'll wish you'd had it years ago.
